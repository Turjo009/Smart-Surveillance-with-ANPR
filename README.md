Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System for Enhanced Security &amp; Compliance

# Project Overview

Our team has developed an innovative ANPR system leveraging machine learning and optical character recognition (OCR) technology. The system functions as follows:

1. **Image Capture**: Captures snapshots of vehicles from existing CCTV footage.
2. **Number Plate Identification**: Employs machine learning to accurately locate and crop number plates from the images.
3. **OCR Extraction**: Utilizes OCR to extract the alphanumeric characters from the cropped number plates.
4. **Database Verification**: Conducts real-time checks against a local public database to validate registration status.

## Key Benefits

- **Cost-Effective**: Eliminates the need for expensive dedicated ANPR hardware by utilizing existing CCTV infrastructure.
- **Reduced Drive-Offs**: Acts as a deterrent for fuel theft and other drive-off incidents, as offenders know their vehicle is being recorded and identified.
- **Decreased Number Plate Fraud**: Helps combat the use of stolen or cloned number plates by instantly verifying registration validity.
- **Improved Compliance**: Assists law enforcement in identifying unregistered or uninsured vehicles, leading to better road safety.
- **Data Insights**: Generates valuable data on traffic patterns, peak times, and potential high-risk areas.

## Technical Highlights

- **Machine Learning**: Employs advanced algorithms for accurate number plate detection and cropping.
- **OCR**: Utilizes robust OCR software for reliable character extraction, even in challenging conditions.
- **Real-Time Database Integration**: Seamlessly connects to public databases for immediate registration verification.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project stemmed from the rising incidents of drive-offs, number plate theft, and the increasing need for efficient vehicle monitoring in various settings. We saw an opportunity to leverage existing technology to create a cost-effective solution that could address these challenges.

## What it Does

Our ANPR system captures images from existing CCTV cameras, identifies and extracts number plate information using machine learning and OCR, and then cross-references this data with a local public database to instantly verify registration status. This provides real-time alerts for unregistered, stolen, or wanted vehicles.

## How We Built It

We utilized a combination of open-source tools, custom scripts, and cloud-based services:

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and manipulation.
- **EasyOCR**: For extracting characters from the number plate images.
- **Python**: As the primary programming language for scripting and integrating the various components.

## Challenges We Ran Into

- **Data Quality**: Gathering and cleaning a diverse dataset of number plate images to train our machine learning model proved to be a time-consuming task.
- **Environmental Factors**: Varying lighting conditions, camera angles, and weather conditions made number plate detection and character recognition more complex.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Achieving real-time processing speed while maintaining accuracy required optimization of our algorithms and hardware selection.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: By leveraging existing CCTV infrastructure and open-source software, we developed a solution that is significantly more affordable than traditional ANPR systems.
- **Real-World Impact**: Our system has already proven its effectiveness in reducing drive-offs and assisting in the identification of stolen vehicles.

## What We Learned

- **Importance of Data**: The quality and diversity of training data are crucial for the success of machine learning models.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Balancing real-time performance with accuracy requires careful optimization of algorithms and hardware.
- **Collaboration**: Working as a team with diverse skill sets was essential to overcoming the challenges and achieving our goals.

## What's Next for Number Plate Scan

- **Enhanced Analytics**: We plan to incorporate more advanced analytics to generate insights on traffic patterns, peak times, and potential high-risk areas.
- **Cloud Integration**: Further integration with cloud-based services for scalability and easier deployment.
- **Mobile Alerts**: Developing a mobile app to provide real-time alerts to relevant stakeholders (e.g., gas station attendants, law enforcement).
- **Expanding Applications**: Exploring the potential use of our ANPR system in other areas such as parking management, toll collection, and traffic monitoring.
